Relational Databases -> "tables" of fields and values (ex. one table for person, one for address), and connect them with an ID
    -well normalized data -> data that doesn't repeat itself

Generally, take data from multiple "tables" and combine into one table

How does Javascript store data?: an array of objects
EX.
[
    {
        ID: 2,
        Firstname: "John",
        Lastname: "Doe",
        Address: "555 Main St."
    },
    {
        ID: 2,
        Firstname: "Jane",
        Lastname: "Doe",
        Address: "555 Main St."
    }
]
