New version of Javascript: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
V8 Javascript engine

babeljs.io takes ES6 Javascript and converts to an older version of Javascript

When writing ES6, you might need a jsconfig.json file to tell .vscode that the language is in ES6

Syntactic sugar -> a feature that only changes how something is typed, not how it's run under the hood
