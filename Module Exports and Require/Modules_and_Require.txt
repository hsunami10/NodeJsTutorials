module -> a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code
module.exports -> module is an object with property exports

require is a function, only called once when used
require("path") = module.exports
require returns the module object's exports property

mutating -> changing the object (not setting the object equal to another value) -> not replacing
    ex. adding a function, not setting it equal to a function
